# clean_segmentation_models
This repo goal is to implement clean, understandable and single file segmentation models. As opposed to creating modules that others can import in their project, here we aim to write code that you can copy paste into your project time and time again (which is generally much more useful for researchers than modules that reduce flexibility).
